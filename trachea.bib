abstract={A system for the automatic segmentation of the pulmonary vasculature in thoracic CT scans is presented. The method is based on a vesselness filter and includes a local thresholding procedure to accurately segment vessels of varying diameters. The output of an automatic segmentation of the airways is used to remove false positive detections in the airway walls. The algorithm is tested with a quantitative evaluation framework based on manual classification of well-dispersed local maxima and random points on ten axial sections in a scan. The algorithm has been applied to ten low dose CT scans annotated by two observers. Results show that local thresholding and airway wall removal both improve segmentation performance and that the accuracy of the proposed method approaches the interobserver variability.},

abstract={This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for segmenting the Pulmonary Artery (PA) tree in 3D pulmonary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) images. In this algorithm, to reduce the search area the lung regions from the original image are first segmented and the heart region is extracted by selecting the regions between the lungs. A pre-processing algorithm based on Hessian matrix and its eigenvalues is used to remove the connectivity between the pulmonary artery and other nearby pulmonary organs. To extract the pulmonary artery tree, we first use a region growing method initialized by a seed point which is automatically selected within the pulmonary artery trunk in the heart region. In the second step, the segmentation of the pulmonary artery is performed using a 3D level set algorithm, using the output of region grower as the initial contour. We use a new stopping criterion for the used level set algorithm, a consideration often neglected in many level set implementations. To validate and assess the robustness of the method, 20 CT angiography datasets were used (10 free pulmonary embolism scans and 10 CT with pulmonary emboli). A very good agreement with the visual judgment was obtained in both normal and positive pulmonary emboli CT scans.},

The present document proposes a technique applied to CT images already diagnosed as embolism positive. In order to perform the segmentation of the arterial tree, the lung's region is transformed into a mask, so that the processed volume gets reduced. Then, through thresholding, region growing, and morphological operations the arterial tree is segmented in 3D. The proposed technique was evaluated by means of arterial counting in each segmented slice as well as in the original ones. That technique got a 93.72% of arterial matching on six datasets of CT images.},

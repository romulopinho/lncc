  abstract = {Purpose: To compare the results obtained by using numerical flow simulations
	with the results of combined single photon emission computed tomography
	(SPECT) and computed tomography (CT) and to demonstrate the importance
	of correct boundary conditions for the numerical methods to account
	for the large amount of interpatient variability in airway geometry.Materials
	and Methods: This study was approved by all relevant institutional
	review boards. All patients gave their signed informed consent. In
	this study, six patients with mild asthma (three men; three women;
	overall mean age, 46 years ± 17 [standard deviation]) underwent CT
	at functional residual capacity and total lung capacity, as well
	as SPECT/CT. CT data were used for segmentation and computational
	fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. A comparison was made between airflow
	distribution, as derived with (a) SPECT/CT through tracer concentration
	analysis, (b) CT through lobar expansion measurement, and (c) CFD
	through flow computer simulation. Also, the heterogeneity of the
	ventilation was examined.Results: Good agreement was found between
	SPECT/CT, CT, and CFD in terms of airflow distribution and hot spot
	detection. The average difference for the internal airflow distribution
	was less than 3% for CFD and CT versus SPECT/CT. Heterogeneity in
	ventilation patterns could be detected with SPECT/CT and CFD.Conclusion:
	This results of this study show that patient-specific computer simulations
	with appropriate boundary conditions yield information that is similar
	to that obtained with functional imaging tools, such as SPECT/CT.©

  abstract = {Medical imaging now enables measurement of the lung in vivo at controlled
	volumes, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated
	models of the geometry of the lung, from the largest airways and

	methods for deriving subject-specific models of the airway and pulmonary
	vascular trees and have developed methods to represent the structure
	of alveolated parenchymal tissue and the segmented alveolo-capillary
	network. These multi-scale models have geometry that is consistent
	with published lung morphometry and have defined relationships with
	one another. The models can therefore be readily exploited to couple
	multiple processes at the same physical scale (e.g., tissue mechanics
	and blood flow), or to couple over multiple scales (e.g., Newtonian
	flow in the large elastic blood vessels, and two-phase fluid transit
	in the microcirculation). We have studied function in the peripheral
	pulmonary system (alveolated airways and accompanying arterial and
	venous vessels) using a multi-scale approach that integrates detailed
	structure at this level of interest with estimates of air, blood
	and tissue pressures from functional models in the larger airways
	and vessels and simulations of soft tissue deformation of the whole
	lung. This approach allows us to study how ventilation of the acinus,
	mixing of inert gases and perfusion of the capillary bed varies with
	gravity, location in the lung and posture. An extension of the multi-scale
	models is incorporation of respiratory gas exchange, which can also
	be considered at several scales of interest.},

	imaging is complicated by intersubject and interspecies differences
	in airway geometry. The application of computational models in understanding
	the significance of these differences requires methods for generation
	of subject-specific geometric models of the bronchial airway tree.
	In the current study, curvilinear airway centerline and diameter
	models have been fitted to human and ovine bronchial trees using
	detailed data segmented from multidetector row X-ray-computed tomography
	scans. The trees have been extended to model the entire conducting
	airway system by using a volume-filling algorithm to generate airway
	centerline locations within detailed volume descriptions of the lungs
	or lobes. Analysis of the geometry of the scan-based and model-based
	airways has verified their consistency with measures from previous
	anatomic studies and has provided new anatomic data for the ovine
	bronchial tree. With the use of an identical parameter set, the volume-filling
	algorithm has produced airway trees with branching asymmetry appropriate
	for the human and ovine lung, demonstrating the dependence of the
	method on the shape of the lung or lobe volume. The modeling approach
	that has been developed can be applied to any level of detail of
	the airway tree and into any volume shape for the lung; hence it
	can be used directly for different individuals or animals and for
	any number of scan-based airways. The resulting models are subject-specific
	computational meshes with anatomically consistent geometry, suitable
	for application in simulation studies. },

	deposition in a human 16-generation tracheobronchial airway model}},
  journal = {Journal of Aerosol Science},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {40},

  number = {1},
  abstract = { A representative human tracheobronchial tree has been geometrically
	represented with adjustable triple-bifurcation units (TBUs) in order
	to effectively simulate local and global micron particle depositions.
	It is the first comprehensive attempt to compute micron-particle
	transport in a (Weibel Type A) 16-generation model with realistic
	inlet conditions. The CFD modeling predictions are compared to experimental
	observations as well as analytical modeling results. Based on the
	findings with the validated computer simulation model, the following
	conclusions can be drawn: (i) Surprisingly, simulated inspiratory
	deposition fractions for the entire tracheobronchial region (say,
	G0-G15) with repeated TBUs in parallel and in series agree rather
	well with those calculated using analytical/semi-empirical expressions.
	However, the predicted particle-deposition fractions based on such
	analytical formulas differ greatly from the present simulation results
	for most local bifurcations, due to the effects of local geometry
	and resulting local flow features and particle distributions. Clearly,
	the effects of realistic geometries, flow structures and particle
	distributions in different individual bifurcations accidentally cancel
	each other so that the simulated deposition efficiencies during inspiration
	in a relatively large airway region may agree quite well with those
	obtained from analytical expressions. Furthermore, with the lack
	of local resolution, analytical models do not provide any physical
	insight to the air-particle dynamics in the tracheobronchial region.
	(ii) The maximum deposition enhancement factors (DEF) may be in the
	order of 102 to 103 for micron particles in the tracheobronchial
	airways, implying potential health effects when the inhaled particles
	are toxic. (iii) The presence of sedimentation for micron particles
	in lower bronchial airways may change the local impaction-based deposition
	patterns seen for larger airways and hence reduces the maximum DEF
	values. (iv) Rotation of an airway bifurcation cause a significant
	impact on distal bifurcations rather than on the proximal ones. Such
	geometric effects are minor when compared to the effects of airflow
	and particle transport/deposition history, i.e., upstream effects.},

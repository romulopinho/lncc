  abstract = {Single ventricle malformations are complex congenital heart defects
	which require a three-stage surgical treatment, starting from the
	very first days of life, to separate the systemic and pulmonary circulations,
	and restore the serial circuit occurring in normal patients. The
	final surgery results in a total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC),
	where both the superior and the inferior vena cava are connected
	to the right pulmonary artery. Several clinical and computational
	studies have been done to optimize the geometry of the TCPC, with
	the aim of minimizing energy losses and improving surgical outcomes.
	To date, only few modeling studies have taken into account respiration
	and exercise as important factors to quantify the performance of
	a Fontan geometry.
	
	The objective of this work is to test the dependence of fluid dynamic
	variables and energy efficiency on respiration in patient-specific
	models of Fontan circulation, when subjected to exercise tests.
	
	A closed-loop multiscale approach was used, including a simple respiration
	model that modulates the extravascular pressures in the thoracic
	and abdominal cavities, to generate physiologic time-varying flow
	conditions. A lumped parameter network (LPN) representing the whole
	circulation was coupled to a patient-specific 3D finite volume model
	of the preoperative bidirectional cavo-pulmonary anastomosis (BCPA)
	with detailed pulmonary anatomy. Subsequently, three virtual TCPC
	alternatives were coupled to the LPN and investigated in terms of
	both local and global hemodynamics. In particular, a T-junction of
	the venae cavae to the pulmonary arteries, a design with an offset
	between the venae cavae and a Y-graft design were compared under
	exercise conditions.
	
	Results showed that the BCPA model is able to realistically capture
	oscillations due to both cardiac and respiratory effects, when compared
	to the venous Doppler velocity tracings acquired preoperatively on
	the patient.
	
	The differences in hemodynamics between the three investigated TCPC
	options were minimal and similar to those obtained without inclusion
	of respiratory effects. Hence, the three surgical options result
	to be equivalent according to the analyzed parameters.
	
	Moreover, although the simulation of the Fontan circulation with a
	respiratory model requires a longer computational time, the developed
	framework allows for a more physiologic method to incorporate respiratory
	effects that was not possible using other methods.},

	all branches, with peak velocities near the wall of the bifurcation.
	In the signal plane the velocity profiles were nearly symmetric,
	exhibiting a single peak near the center in the frontal plane and
	almost flat in the sagital plane. Overall, the velocity profiles
	were more sensitive to airway geometry than to flow rate. The only
	site of flow separation was observd in the right upper lobar bronchus.

	and Methods: This study was approved by all relevant institutional

	this study, six patients with mild asthma (three men; three women;
	overall mean age, 46 years ± 17 [standard deviation]) underwent CT
	at functional residual capacity and total lung capacity, as well
	as SPECT/CT. CT data were used for segmentation and computational
	fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. A comparison was made between airflow
	distribution, as derived with (a) SPECT/CT through tracer concentration
	analysis, (b) CT through lobar expansion measurement, and (c) CFD
	through flow computer simulation. Also, the heterogeneity of the
	ventilation was examined.Results: Good agreement was found between
	SPECT/CT, CT, and CFD in terms of airflow distribution and hot spot
	detection. The average difference for the internal airflow distribution
	was less than 3% for CFD and CT versus SPECT/CT. Heterogeneity in
	ventilation patterns could be detected with SPECT/CT and CFD.Conclusion:
	This results of this study show that patient-specific computer simulations
	with appropriate boundary conditions yield information that is similar
	to that obtained with functional imaging tools, such as SPECT/CT.©

  abstract = {The flow field at inspiration and expiration in the upper human airways
	consisting of the trachea down to the sixth generation of the bronchial
	tree is numerically simulated. The three-dimensional steady flow
	at a hydraulic diameter-based Reynolds number ReD=1250 is computed
	via a lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM). The simulation is validated
	by the experimental data based on particle-image velocimetry (PIV)
	measurements. The good agreement between numerical and experimental
	results is evidenced by comparing velocity contours and distributions
	in a defined reference plane. The results show the LBM to be an accurate
	tool to numerically predict flow structures in the human lung. Using
	an automatic Cartesian grid generator, the overall process time from
	meshing to a steady-state solution is &lt;12&#xa0;h. Moreover, the
	numerical simulation allows a closer analysis of the secondary flow
	structures than in the experimental investigation. The three-dimensional
	streamline patterns reveal some insight on the air exchange mechanism
	at inspiration and expiration. At inspiration, the slower near-wall
	tracheal flow enters through the right principal bronchus into the
	right upper lobar bronchus. The bulk mass flux in the trachea is
	nearly evenly distributed over the left upper, center and lower lobar
	bronchi and the right center and lower bronchi. At expiration, the
	air from the right upper lobar bronchus enters the right center of
	the trachea and displaces the airflow from the lower and center right
	bronchi such that the tracheal positions of the streamlines at inspiration
	and expiration are switched. The flow in the left bronchi does not
	show this kind of switching. The findings emphasize the impact of
	the asymmetry of the lung geometry on the respiratory air exchange

  abstract = {Particle deposition in the human respiratory tract is determined by
	biological factors such as lung morphology and breathing patterns,
	and physical factors such as fluid dynamics, particle properties,
	and deposition mechanisms. Current particle deposition models may
	be grouped into two categories referring to the region of interest
	in the lung, i.e. either deposition in the whole lung (whole lung
	models), or deposition in a localized region of the lung (local scale
	models). In whole lung models, particle deposition in individual
	airways is computed by analytical equations for particle deposition
	efficiencies and specific flow conditions (analytical models). The
	present review focuses upon the philosophy of different conceptual
	whole lung models to determine deposition in bronchial and acinar
	airway generations, and to compare the deposition patterns predicted
	by these models. Since any modelling approach requires validation
	by comparison with the available experimental evidence, predicted
	deposition data are compared with published experimental data in
	human subjects. This comparison indicates that, at least during the
	writing of this review, deposition models can be validated only for
	total and, to some extent, for regional deposition. In local scale
	models, particle transport and deposition equations are solved by
	Computational Fluid and Particle Dynamics (CFPD) methods (numerical
	models), providing information on particle deposition patterns within
	selected structural elements of the lung, e.g. bronchial bifurcations.

	with asymmetric airway extracted from the 5th?11th branches of the
	model of Weibel (Morphometry of the Human Lung. New York Academic
	Press, Verlag, 1963) in order to more appropriately model human air
	passage. Computations are carried out in the Reynolds number range
	200?1600, corresponding to mouth-air breathing rates ranging from
	0.27 to 2.16&#xa0;l/s, representative for an averaged height man
	breathing from quiet to vigorous state. Particular attentions are
	paid to establishing relations between the Reynolds number and the
	overall flow characteristics, including flow patterns and pressure
	drop. The study shows that the ratios of airflow rate through the
	medial branches to that of their mother branches are the same, and
	this is also true for the ratios of airflow rate through the lateral
	branches. This partially explains why regular human breathing is
	not affected by airways of different sizes.},

	was used to conduct detailed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations
	during expiration, to investigate the fluid flow in the airway regions
	where obstruction could occur. An identical physical model of the
	same airway was built using stereo lithography. Pressure and velocity
	measurements were conducted in the physical model. Both simulations
	and experiments were performed at a peak expiratory flow rate of
	200&#xa0;L/min. Several different numerical approaches within the
	FLUENT commercial software framework were used in the simulations;
	unsteady Large Eddy Simulation (LES), steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
	(RANS) with two-equation turbulence models (i.e. k??, standard k??,
	and k?? Shear Stress Transport (SST)) and with one-equation Spalart?Allmaras
	model. The CFD predictions of the average wall static pressures at
	different locations along the airway wall were favorably compared
	with the experimental data. Among all the approaches, standard k??
	turbulence model resulted in the best agreement with the static pressure
	measurements, with an average error of ?20% over all ports. The highest
	positive pressures were observed in the retroglossal regions below
	the epiglottis, while the lowest negative pressures were recorded
	in the retropalatal region. The latter is a result of the airflow
	acceleration in the narrow retropalatal region. The largest pressure
	drop was observed at the tip of the soft palate. This location has
	the smallest cross section of the airway. The good agreement between
	the computations and the experimental results suggest that CFD simulations
	can be used to accurately compute aerodynamic flow characteristics

  abstract = {A new lung model that incorporates intra-acinar diffusion- and convection-dependent
	inhomogeneities (DCDI) and interregional and intraregional convection-dependent
	inhomogeneities (CDI) is described. The model is divided into two
	regions, each containing two subunits. Each of the four subunits
	in the model consists of a multi-branch-point structure, based on
	the anatomic data from Haefeli-Bleuer and Weibel (Anat. Record 220:
	401-414, 1988). The subunit turnover (TO), i.e., the ratio of subunit
	tidal to resting volume, and the flow sequences (FS) between the
	subunits are used as model parameters. The model simulates the normalized
	alveolar slope (Sn), Fowler and Bohr dead space (VDF and VDB), and
	alveolar mixing efficiency (AME) as a function of breath number (n)
	during a multiple-breath N2 washout (MBNW). For the first breath
	of the MBNW, these indexes are poorly sensitive to the TO distribution
	or FS between the subunits. However, as the washout proceeds, the
	n dependence of both Sn and VDB becomes markedly distinct for simulations
	with different TO and FS. VDF increases only slightly with n during
	the MBNW for a large range of TO and FS combinations, and AME is
	independent of FS. Comparison of published experimental observations
	with model simulations gave a consistent picture of ventilation maldistribution
	in the human lung. MBNW simulations in conditions of weightlessness,
	which will be performed shortly in Spacelab, suggest that it will
	be possible to evaluate quantitatively the intraregional elastic
	inhomogeneities in the human lung.},

  abstract = {Airway hyperresponsiveness is a major characteristic of asthma and
	is believed to result from the excessive contraction of airway smooth
	muscle cells (SMCs). However, the identification of the mechanisms
	responsible for airway hyperresponsiveness is hindered by our limited
	understanding of how calcium (Ca2+), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK),
	and myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) interact to regulate airway
	SMC contraction. In this work, we present a modified Hai-Murphy cross-bridge
	model of SMC contraction that incorporates Ca2+ regulation of MLCK
	and MLCP. A comparative fit of the model simulations to experimental
	data predicts 1), that airway and arteriole SMC contraction is initiated
	by fast activation by Ca2+ of MLCK; 2), that airway SMC, but not
	arteriole SMC, is inhibited by a slower activation by Ca2+ of MLCP;
	and 3), that the presence of a contractile agonist inhibits MLCP
	to enhance the Ca2+ sensitivity of airway and arteriole SMCs. The
	implication of these findings is that murine airway SMCs exploit
	a Ca2+-dependent mechanism to favor a default state of relaxation.
	The rate of SMC relaxation is determined principally by the rate
	of release of the latch-bridge state, which is predicted to be faster
	in airway than in arteriole. In addition, the model also predicts
	that oscillations in calcium concentration, commonly observed during
	agonist-induced smooth muscle contraction, cause a significantly
	greater contraction than an elevated steady calcium concentration.},

  abstract = {Development and optimization of methods for adequately accounting
	for respiratory motion in radiation therapy of thoracic tumors require
	detailed knowledge of respiratory dynamics and its impact on corresponding
	dose distributions. Thus, computer aided modeling and simulation
	of respiratory motion have become increasingly important. In this
	article a biophysical approach for modeling respiratory lung motion
	is described: Major aspects of the process of lung ventilation are
	formulated as a contact problem of elasticity theory which is solved
	by finite element methods; lung tissue is assumed to be isotropic,
	homogeneous, and linearly elastic. A main focus of the article is
	to assess the impact of biomechanical parameters (values of elastic
	constants) on the modeling process and to evaluate modeling accuracy.
	Patient-specific models are generated based on 4D CT data of 12 lung
	tumor patients. Simulated motion patterns of inner lung landmarks
	are compared with corresponding motion patterns observed in the 4D
	CT data. Mean absolute differences between model-based predicted
	landmark motion and corresponding breathing-induced landmark displacements
	as observed in the CT data sets are in the order of 3 mm (end expiration
	to end inspiration) and 2 mm (end expiration to midrespiration).
	Modeling accuracy decreases with increasing tumor size both locally
	(landmarks close to tumor) and globally (landmarks in other parts
	of the lung). The impact of the values of the elastic constants appears
	to be small. Outcomes show that the modeling approach is an adequate
	strategy in predicting lung dynamics due to lung ventilation. Nevertheless,
	the decreased prediction quality in cases of large tumors demands
	further study of the influence of lung tumors on global and local
	lung elasticity properties.},

  abstract = {A multi-technique approach to modelling artificially ventilated patients
	on the adult general intensive care unit (ICU) is proposed. Compartmental
	modelling techniques were used to describe the mechanical ventilator
	and the flexible hoses that connect it to the patient. 3D CFD techniques
	were used to model flow in the major airways and a Windkessel style
	balloon model was used to model the mechanical properties of the
	lungs. A multi-compartment model of the lung based on bifurcating
	tree structures representing the conducting airways and pulmonary
	circulation allowed lung disease to be modelled in terms of altered
	V ? / Q ? ratios within a lognormal distribution of values and it
	is from these that gas exchange was determined. A compartmental modelling
	tool, Bathfp, was used to integrate the different modelling techniques
	into a single model. The values of key parameters in the model could
	be obtained from measurements on patients in an ICU whilst a sensitivity
	analysis showed that the model was insensitive to the value of other
	parameters within it. Measured and modelled values for arterial blood
	gases and airflow parameters are compared for 46 ventilator settings
	obtained from 6 ventilator dependent patients. The results show correlation
	coefficients of 0.88 and 0.85 for the arterial partial pressures
	of the O2 and CO2, respectively (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01) and of 0.99
	and 0.96 for upper airway pressure and tidal volume, respectively
	(p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01). The difference between measured and modelled
	values was large in physiological terms, suggesting that some optimisation
	of the model is required.},

  abstract = { A representative human tracheobronchial tree has been geometrically
	represented with adjustable triple-bifurcation units (TBUs) in order
	to effectively simulate local and global micron particle depositions.
	It is the first comprehensive attempt to compute micron-particle
	transport in a (Weibel Type A) 16-generation model with realistic
	inlet conditions. The CFD modeling predictions are compared to experimental
	observations as well as analytical modeling results. Based on the
	findings with the validated computer simulation model, the following
	conclusions can be drawn: (i) Surprisingly, simulated inspiratory
	deposition fractions for the entire tracheobronchial region (say,
	G0-G15) with repeated TBUs in parallel and in series agree rather
	well with those calculated using analytical/semi-empirical expressions.
	However, the predicted particle-deposition fractions based on such
	analytical formulas differ greatly from the present simulation results
	for most local bifurcations, due to the effects of local geometry
	and resulting local flow features and particle distributions. Clearly,
	the effects of realistic geometries, flow structures and particle
	distributions in different individual bifurcations accidentally cancel
	each other so that the simulated deposition efficiencies during inspiration
	in a relatively large airway region may agree quite well with those
	obtained from analytical expressions. Furthermore, with the lack
	of local resolution, analytical models do not provide any physical
	insight to the air-particle dynamics in the tracheobronchial region.
	(ii) The maximum deposition enhancement factors (DEF) may be in the
	order of 102 to 103 for micron particles in the tracheobronchial
	airways, implying potential health effects when the inhaled particles
	are toxic. (iii) The presence of sedimentation for micron particles
	in lower bronchial airways may change the local impaction-based deposition
	patterns seen for larger airways and hence reduces the maximum DEF
	values. (iv) Rotation of an airway bifurcation cause a significant
	impact on distal bifurcations rather than on the proximal ones. Such
	geometric effects are minor when compared to the effects of airflow
	and particle transport/deposition history, i.e., upstream effects.},

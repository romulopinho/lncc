Atherosclerosis figures as one of the leading cardiovascular diseases, which remain as the major cause of death in developed countries. Image analysis and processing is an important tool in the diagnosis and treatment of vascular diseases. Minimally invasive interventions are increasingly becoming the treatment option of choice, given the reduced surgical risk for the patient. A good example is the use of stents to reopen vascular stenosis or to protect the dilated walls of aneurysms from further expansion. Stent choice remains, nevertheless, a subjective decision. An inadequate stent may migrate to another location, may exert exaggerated pressure on the vessel walls, may not properly cover the affected area, etc. 

This document describes a project proposal whose aims are twofold.  for the automatic detection and quantification of stenosis and aneurysms and for the automatic prediction of optimal patient-specific stent parameters. The proposed methods build upon the work presented in my PhD thesis, which focussed on the assessment and stenting of tracheal stenosis. They also integrate physical properties of blood vessels and stents, as well as stent deployment and blood flow simulations, into the stent choice process.

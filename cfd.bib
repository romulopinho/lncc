abstract = {Single ventricle malformations are complex congenital heart defects
which require a three-stage surgical treatment, starting from the
very first days of life, to separate the systemic and pulmonary circulations,
and restore the serial circuit occurring in normal patients. The
final surgery results in a total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC),
where both the superior and the inferior vena cava are connected
to the right pulmonary artery. Several clinical and computational
studies have been done to optimize the geometry of the TCPC, with
the aim of minimizing energy losses and improving surgical outcomes.
To date, only few modeling studies have taken into account respiration
and exercise as important factors to quantify the performance of
a Fontan geometry.

The objective of this work is to test the dependence of fluid dynamic
variables and energy efficiency on respiration in patient-specific
models of Fontan circulation, when subjected to exercise tests.

A closed-loop multiscale approach was used, including a simple respiration
model that modulates the extravascular pressures in the thoracic
and abdominal cavities, to generate physiologic time-varying flow
conditions. A lumped parameter network (LPN) representing the whole
circulation was coupled to a patient-specific 3D finite volume model
of the preoperative bidirectional cavo-pulmonary anastomosis (BCPA)
with detailed pulmonary anatomy. Subsequently, three virtual TCPC
alternatives were coupled to the LPN and investigated in terms of
both local and global hemodynamics. In particular, a T-junction of
the venae cavae to the pulmonary arteries, a design with an offset
between the venae cavae and a Y-graft design were compared under
exercise conditions.

Results showed that the BCPA model is able to realistically capture
oscillations due to both cardiac and respiratory effects, when compared
to the venous Doppler velocity tracings acquired preoperatively on
the patient.

The differences in hemodynamics between the three investigated TCPC
options were minimal and similar to those obtained without inclusion
of respiratory effects. Hence, the three surgical options result
to be equivalent according to the analyzed parameters.

Moreover, although the simulation of the Fontan circulation with a
respiratory model requires a longer computational time, the developed
framework allows for a more physiologic method to incorporate respiratory
effects that was not possible using other methods.},

abstract = {Studies of the origin of pulmonary blood flow heterogeneity have highlighted
the significant role of vessel branching structure on flow distribution.
To enable more detailed investigation of structure-function relationships
in the pulmonary circulation, an anatomically based finite element
model of the arterial and venous networks has been developed to more
accurately reflect the geometry found in vivo. Geometric models of
the arterial and venous tree structures are created using a combination
of multidetector row X-ray computed tomography imaging to define
around 2,500 vessels from each tree, a volume-filling branching algorithm
to generate the remaining accompanying conducting vessels, and an
empirically based algorithm to generate the supernumerary vessel
geometry. The explicit generation of supernumerary vessels is a unique
feature of the computational model. Analysis of branching properties
and geometric parameters demonstrates close correlation between the
model geometry and anatomical measures of human pulmonary blood vessels.
A total of 12 Strahler orders for the arterial system and 10 Strahler
orders for the venous system are generated, down to the equivalent
level of the terminal bronchioles in the bronchial tree. A simple
Poiseuille flow solution, assuming rigid vessels, is obtained within
the arterial geometry of the left lung, demonstrating a large amount
of heterogeneity in the flow distribution, especially with inclusion
of supernumerary vessels. This model has been constructed to accurately
represent available morphometric data derived from the complex asymmetric
branching structure of the human pulmonary vasculature in a form
that will be suitable for application in functional simulations.},

abstract = {The essential function of the lung, gas exchange, is dependent on
adequate matching of ventilation and perfusion, where air and blood
are delivered through complex branching systems exposed to regionally
varying transpulmonary and transmural pressures. Structure and function
in the lung are intimately related, yet computational models in pulmonary
physiology usually simplify or neglect structure. The geometries
of the airway and vascular systems and their interaction with parenchymal
tissue have an important bearing on regional distributions of air
and blood, and therefore on whole lung gas exchange, but this has
not yet been addressed by modelling studies. Models for gas exchange
have typically incorporated considerable detail at the level of chemical
reactions, with little thought for the influence of structure. To
date, relatively little attention has been paid to modelling at the
cellular or subcellular level in the lung, or to linking information
from the protein structure/interaction and cellular levels to the
operation of the whole lung. We review previous work in developing
anatomically based models of the lung, airways, parenchyma and pulmonary
vasculature, and some functional studies in which these models have
been used. Models for gas exchange at several spatial scales are
briefly reviewed, and the challenges and benefits from modelling
cellular function in the lung are discussed.},

abstract = {We measured detailed steady inspiratory and expiratory velocity profiles
in a 3:1 scale model of the human central airways. The model was
constructed out of acrylic plastic, mounted vertically, and connected
to a specially designed steady-flow system. Laterally introduced
hot-wire anemoneter probes were used to record axial velocities along
4 diameters at each of the 12 pre-drilled stations of measurement;
the flow distribution among the five lobar bronchi was controlled
by distally positioned linear resistors. Whether with a flat entrance
profile or entering as a narrow jet, the inspiratory flow velocity
profiles in the frontal plane showed a high degree of asymmetry in
all branches, with peak velocities near the wall of the bifurcation.
In the signal plane the velocity profiles were nearly symmetric,
exhibiting a single peak near the center in the frontal plane and
almost flat in the sagital plane. Overall, the velocity profiles
were more sensitive to airway geometry than to flow rate. The only
site of flow separation was observd in the right upper lobar bronchus.
The most evident modification of axial velocity profiles in a single
branch was found in the left main bronchus during expiratory flow.},

abstract = {Purpose: To compare the results obtained by using numerical flow simulations
with the results of combined single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) and computed tomography (CT) and to demonstrate the importance
of correct boundary conditions for the numerical methods to account
for the large amount of interpatient variability in airway geometry.Materials
and Methods: This study was approved by all relevant institutional
review boards. All patients gave their signed informed consent. In
this study, six patients with mild asthma (three men; three women;
overall mean age, 46 years � 17 [standard deviation]) underwent CT
at functional residual capacity and total lung capacity, as well
as SPECT/CT. CT data were used for segmentation and computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. A comparison was made between airflow
distribution, as derived with (a) SPECT/CT through tracer concentration
analysis, (b) CT through lobar expansion measurement, and (c) CFD
through flow computer simulation. Also, the heterogeneity of the
ventilation was examined.Results: Good agreement was found between
SPECT/CT, CT, and CFD in terms of airflow distribution and hot spot
detection. The average difference for the internal airflow distribution
was less than 3\% for CFD and CT versus SPECT/CT. Heterogeneity in
ventilation patterns could be detected with SPECT/CT and CFD.Conclusion:
This results of this study show that patient-specific computer simulations
with appropriate boundary conditions yield information that is similar
to that obtained with functional imaging tools, such as SPECT/CT.�

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is increasingly applied in the
respiratory domain. The ability to simulate the flow through a bifurcating
tubular system has increased the insight into the internal flow dynamics
and the particular characteristics of respiratory flows such as secondary
motions and inertial effects. The next step in the evolution is to
apply the technique to patient-specific cases, in order to provide
more information about pathological airways. This study presents
a patient-specific approach where both the geometry and the boundary
conditions (BC) are based on individual imaging methods using computed
tomography (CT). The internal flow distribution of a 73-year-old
female suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
is assessed. The validation is performed through the comparison of
lung ventilation with gamma scintigraphy. The results show that in
order to obtain agreement within the accuracy limits of the gamma
scintigraphy scan, both the patient-specific geometry and the BC
(driving pressure) play a crucial role. A minimal invasive test (CT
scan) supplied enough information to perform an accurate CFD analysis.
In the end it was possible to capture the pathological features of
the respiratory system using the imaging and computational fluid
dynamics techniques. This brings the introduction of this new technique
in the clinical practice one step closer.},

abstract = {The flow field at inspiration and expiration in the upper human airways
consisting of the trachea down to the sixth generation of the bronchial
tree is numerically simulated. The three-dimensional steady flow
at a hydraulic diameter-based Reynolds number ReD=1250 is computed
via a lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM). The simulation is validated
by the experimental data based on particle-image velocimetry (PIV)
measurements. The good agreement between numerical and experimental
results is evidenced by comparing velocity contours and distributions
in a defined reference plane. The results show the LBM to be an accurate
tool to numerically predict flow structures in the human lung. Using
an automatic Cartesian grid generator, the overall process time from
meshing to a steady-state solution is \&lt;12\&\#xa0;h. Moreover, the
numerical simulation allows a closer analysis of the secondary flow
structures than in the experimental investigation. The three-dimensional
streamline patterns reveal some insight on the air exchange mechanism
at inspiration and expiration. At inspiration, the slower near-wall
tracheal flow enters through the right principal bronchus into the
right upper lobar bronchus. The bulk mass flux in the trachea is
nearly evenly distributed over the left upper, center and lower lobar
bronchi and the right center and lower bronchi. At expiration, the
air from the right upper lobar bronchus enters the right center of
the trachea and displaces the airflow from the lower and center right
bronchi such that the tracheal positions of the streamlines at inspiration
and expiration are switched. The flow in the left bronchi does not
show this kind of switching. The findings emphasize the impact of
the asymmetry of the lung geometry on the respiratory air exchange
mechanism.},

abstract = {The interest in lattice-Boltzmann models in the computational hemodynamics realm has increased in recent years. In this context, the correct choice of numerical parameters for the appropriate simulation of blood flows in major arteries is a crucial aspect. For this reason, we present three parameter-tuning strategies that allow us to reproduce correctly the pulsatile time-dependent flow of an incompressible fluid under physiological regimes. These strategies are studied for a model based on a single-relaxation-time approach in combination with second order boundary conditions for both velocity and pressure, and proper equilibrium distributions that take care of the incompressible behavior exhibited by the fluid. The implementation is validated with the three-dimensional Womersley flow benchmark. As well, the simulation of blood flows in a curved artery, in an anastomosed vessel, in a patient specific vertebral artery and in an aneurysmal region are presented in order to show how the method and the setting of the numerical parameters are applied to different realistic hemodynamics problems.},

@article{Hofmann2011,
abstract = {Particle deposition in the human respiratory tract is determined by
biological factors such as lung morphology and breathing patterns,
and physical factors such as fluid dynamics, particle properties,
and deposition mechanisms. Current particle deposition models may
be grouped into two categories referring to the region of interest
in the lung, i.e. either deposition in the whole lung (whole lung
models), or deposition in a localized region of the lung (local scale
models). In whole lung models, particle deposition in individual
airways is computed by analytical equations for particle deposition
efficiencies and specific flow conditions (analytical models). The
present review focuses upon the philosophy of different conceptual
whole lung models to determine deposition in bronchial and acinar
airway generations, and to compare the deposition patterns predicted
by these models. Since any modelling approach requires validation
by comparison with the available experimental evidence, predicted
deposition data are compared with published experimental data in
human subjects. This comparison indicates that, at least during the
writing of this review, deposition models can be validated only for
total and, to some extent, for regional deposition. In local scale
models, particle transport and deposition equations are solved by
Computational Fluid and Particle Dynamics (CFPD) methods (numerical
models), providing information on particle deposition patterns within
selected structural elements of the lung, e.g. bronchial bifurcations.
In this review, however, only their potential contribution to improve
upon current analytical whole lung models will be considered.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional (3-D) model of the human pulmonary acinus, a gas
exchange unit, is constructed with a labyrinthine algorithm generating
branching ducts that fill a given space completely. Branching down
to the third respiratory bronchioles is generated with the proposed
algorithm. A subacinus, a region supplied by the last respiratory
bronchiole, is approximated to be a set of cubic cells with a side
dimension of 0.5 mm. The labyrinthine algorithm is used to determine
a pathway through all cells only once, except at branching points
with the smallest path lengths. In choosing each step of a pathway,
random variables are used. Resulting labyrinths have equal mean path
lengths and equal surface areas of inner walls. An alveolus can be
generated by attaching alveolar septa, 0.25 mm long and 0.1 mm wide,
to the inner walls. Total alveolar surface area and numbers of alveolar

of airflow as well as nano- and micron-size particle deposition in

construction of suitable airway geometries, mathematical description
of the air-particle transport phenomena and computer simulation of
micron and nanoparticle depositions. Specifically, diffusion-dominated
nanomaterial deposits on airway surfaces much more uniformly than
micron particles of the same material. This may imply different toxicity
effects. Due to impaction and secondary flows, micron particles tend
to accumulate around the carinal ridges and to form "hotspots", i.e.,
locally high concentrations which may lead to tumor developments.

with asymmetric airway extracted from the 5th?11th branches of the

breathing from quiet to vigorous state. Particular attentions are
paid to establishing relations between the Reynolds number and the
overall flow characteristics, including flow patterns and pressure
drop. The study shows that the ratios of airflow rate through the
medial branches to that of their mother branches are the same, and
this is also true for the ratios of airflow rate through the lateral
branches. This partially explains why regular human breathing is
not affected by airways of different sizes.},

the transport and deposition of inhaled pharmaceutical aerosols from
the site of particle or droplet formation to deposition within the

are discussed briefly followed by a more in-depth review of three-dimensional
(3-D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The review
of CFD models is organized into sections covering transport and deposition
within the inhaler device, the extrathoracic (oral and nasal) region,
conducting airways, and alveolar space. For each section, a general
review of significant contributions and advancements in the area
of simulating pharmaceutical aerosols is provided followed by a more
in-depth application or case study that highlights the challenges,
utility, and benefits of in silico models. Specific applications
presented include the optimization of an existing spray inhaler,
development of charge-targeted delivery, specification of conditions
for optimal nasal delivery, analysis of a new condensational delivery
approach, and an evaluation of targeted delivery using magnetic aerosols.
The review concludes with recommendations on the need for more refined
model validations, use of a concurrent experimental and CFD approach
for developing aerosol delivery systems, and development of a stochastic
individual path (SIP) model of aerosol transport and deposition throughout

abstract = {An anatomically accurate human upper airway model was constructed
from multiple magnetic resonance imaging axial scans. This model
was used to conduct detailed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations
during expiration, to investigate the fluid flow in the airway regions
where obstruction could occur. An identical physical model of the
same airway was built using stereo lithography. Pressure and velocity
measurements were conducted in the physical model. Both simulations
and experiments were performed at a peak expiratory flow rate of
200\&\#xa0;L/min. Several different numerical approaches within the
FLUENT commercial software framework were used in the simulations;
unsteady Large Eddy Simulation (LES), steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
(RANS) with two-equation turbulence models (i.e. k??, standard k??,
and k?? Shear Stress Transport (SST)) and with one-equation Spalart?Allmaras
model. The CFD predictions of the average wall static pressures at
different locations along the airway wall were favorably compared
with the experimental data. Among all the approaches, standard k??
turbulence model resulted in the best agreement with the static pressure
measurements, with an average error of ?20\% over all ports. The highest
positive pressures were observed in the retroglossal regions below
the epiglottis, while the lowest negative pressures were recorded
in the retropalatal region. The latter is a result of the airflow
acceleration in the narrow retropalatal region. The largest pressure
drop was observed at the tip of the soft palate. This location has
the smallest cross section of the airway. The good agreement between
the computations and the experimental results suggest that CFD simulations
can be used to accurately compute aerodynamic flow characteristics
of the upper airway.},

deposition in geometries representing the human tracheobronchial

on the Weibel A model, and (2) based on a CT scan of a cadaver lung
cast. Flow conditions used included both steady-state inhalation
and exhalation conditions as well as time-dependent breathing cycles.
Particle trajectories were calculated in each of these models by
solving the equations of motion of the particle for the deterministic
portion of particle displacement, and adding a stochastic Brownian
term at each step. The trapping of particles on the wall surfaces
was monitored, and the locations of trapping in each generation were
recorded. The results indicate that there are dramatic differences
in the predicted deposition between the two models. The intragenerational
deposition locations show that in regions where the deposition mechanism
is inertial impaction, the predominant deposition seems to be at
the airway bifurcations. The results of this study suggest that under
most conditions, an idealized model based on the Weibel dimensions
is not sufficient to predict deposition, and an accurate model, such
as those based on imaging techniques may be required.},

abstract = {Medical imaging now enables measurement of the lung in vivo at controlled volumes, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated models of the geometry of the lung, from the largest airways and vessels to the alveolar tissue and capillary bed. We have developed methods for deriving subject-specific models of the airway and pulmonary vascular trees and have developed methods to represent the structure of alveolated parenchymal tissue and the segmented alveolocapillary network. These multi-scale models have geometry that is consistent with published lung morphometry and have defined relationships with one another. The models can therefore be readily exploited to couple multiple processes at the same physical scale (e.g., tissue mechanics and blood flow), or to couple over multiple scales (e.g., Newtonian flow in the large elastic blood vessels, and two-phase fluid transit in the microcirculation). We have studied function in the peripheral pulmonary system (alveolated airways and accompanying arterial and venous vessels) using a multi-scale approach that integrates detailed structure at this level of interest with estimates of air, blood and tissue pressures from functional models in the larger airways and vessels and simulations of soft tissue deformation of the whole lung. This approach allows us to study how ventilation of the acinus, mixing of inert gases and perfusion of the capillary bed varies with gravity, location in the lung and posture.

abstract = {The pulmonary airway, arterial, venous and capillary networks are
vast complex branching and converging systems that are mechanically
coupled to the surrounding lung tissue. Early studies that examined
vascular or airway geometry relied on measurements from casts, but
medical imaging now enables measurement of the lung in vivo, at controlled
lung volumes. The high-quality data that imaging provides have prompted
development of increasingly sophisticated models of the geometry
of the airway and pulmonary vascular trees. The accurate spatial
relationships between airway, vessel and tissue in these imaging-derived
models are necessary for computational analysis that aims to elucidate
regional airway-vessel-tissue interactions. Predictions of blood
flow through multiscale imaging-derived models of the pulmonary arteries
and capillary bed reveal geometry-dependent patterns of perfusion
in response to gravity and lung orientation that cannot be predicted
with simplified, summary representations of the pulmonary transport
trees. Validation of such predictions against measures from functional
imaging holds significant potential for explaining and differentiating
normal and disease-related heterogeneity in regional blood flow calculated
using perfusion imaging.},

abstract = {The interpretation of experimental results from functional medical imaging is complicated by intersubject and interspecies differences in airway geometry. The application of computational models in understanding the significance of these differences requires methods for generation of subject-specific geometric models of the bronchial airway tree. In the current study, curvilinear airway centerline and diameter models have been fitted to human and ovine bronchial trees using detailed data segmented from multidetector row X-ray-computed tomography scans. The trees have been extended to model the entire conducting airway system by using a volume-filling algorithm to generate airway centerline locations within detailed volume descriptions of the lungs or lobes. Analysis of the geometry of the scan-based and model-based airways has verified their consistency with measures from previous anatomic studies and has provided new anatomic data for the ovine bronchial tree. With the use of an identical parameter set, the volume-filling algorithm has produced airway trees with branching asymmetry appropriate for the human and ovine lung, demonstrating the dependence of the method on the shape of the lung or lobe volume. The modeling approach that has been developed can be applied to any level of detail of the airway tree and into any volume shape for the lung; hence it can be used directly for different individuals or animals and for any number of scan-based airways. The resulting models are subject-specific computational meshes with anatomically consistent geometry, suitable for application in simulation studies.},

We have extended a two-dimensional tree-growing algorithm to three dimensions for generation of a host-shape dependent three-dimensional conducting airway model. Terminal branches in the model are both length limited and volume-supplied limited. A limit is imposed on the maximum possible branch angle between a daughter and parent branch. Comparison of the resulting model with morphometric data shows that the algorithm produces branching and length ratios, path lengths, numbers of branches, and branching angles very close to those from the experimental data. The correlation between statistics from the generated model and those from morphometric studies suggests that the conducting airway structure can be described adequately using a "supply and demand" algorithm. The resulting model is a computational mesh that can be used for simulating transport phenomena.},

abstract = {In this work, a multidimensional 3D–1D FEM model of the whole arterial tree is implemented. It comprises a 3D compliant model of the carotid bifurcation coupled with a 1D model for the remaining part of the arterial tree. With this approach, difficulties arising from the treatment of boundary conditions for the 3D model are naturally handled. The Navier–Stokes equations are used as the governing equations for the blood flow while an elastic compliant model is implemented for the arterial wall. Also, the A.L.E. formulation is considered within the 3D blood regions taking into account the domain deformations produced by the moving artery wall. This 3D model is complemented with a 1D model of the entire arterial tree, in order to appropriately set inflow and outflow boundary conditions for the former. The reduced 1D model solves the momentum and continuity equations in compliant tubes so as to reproduce the propagation of the pressure pulse in the arterial network. Also, a volumetric flow rate is imposed at the inlet to model the systolic work of the heart. The peripheral arteriole beds are simulated with the well-known lumped Windkessel model. A standard geometry of the carotid bifurcation is discretized with P1 bubble–P1 tetrahedral elements. The obtained results properly reproduce the general flow patterns reported in the literature. Very good agreement between the outcomes of a pure 1D model and those of the combined multidimensional model was obtained. It is worth noting that this kind of model may provide useful information to gain understanding in the genesis and development of arterial diseases.},

abstract = {A new lung model that incorporates intra-acinar diffusion- and convection-dependent
inhomogeneities (DCDI) and interregional and intraregional convection-dependent
inhomogeneities (CDI) is described. The model is divided into two
regions, each containing two subunits. Each of the four subunits
in the model consists of a multi-branch-point structure, based on
the anatomic data from Haefeli-Bleuer and Weibel (Anat. Record 220:
401-414, 1988). The subunit turnover (TO), i.e., the ratio of subunit
tidal to resting volume, and the flow sequences (FS) between the
subunits are used as model parameters. The model simulates the normalized
alveolar slope (Sn), Fowler and Bohr dead space (VDF and VDB), and
alveolar mixing efficiency (AME) as a function of breath number (n)
during a multiple-breath N2 washout (MBNW). For the first breath
of the MBNW, these indexes are poorly sensitive to the TO distribution
or FS between the subunits. However, as the washout proceeds, the
n dependence of both Sn and VDB becomes markedly distinct for simulations
with different TO and FS. VDF increases only slightly with n during
the MBNW for a large range of TO and FS combinations, and AME is
independent of FS. Comparison of published experimental observations
with model simulations gave a consistent picture of ventilation maldistribution
in the human lung. MBNW simulations in conditions of weightlessness,
which will be performed shortly in Spacelab, suggest that it will
be possible to evaluate quantitatively the intraregional elastic
inhomogeneities in the human lung.},

abstract = {Airway hyperresponsiveness is a major characteristic of asthma and
is believed to result from the excessive contraction of airway smooth
muscle cells (SMCs). However, the identification of the mechanisms
responsible for airway hyperresponsiveness is hindered by our limited
understanding of how calcium (Ca2+), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK),
and myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) interact to regulate airway
SMC contraction. In this work, we present a modified Hai-Murphy cross-bridge
model of SMC contraction that incorporates Ca2+ regulation of MLCK
and MLCP. A comparative fit of the model simulations to experimental
data predicts 1), that airway and arteriole SMC contraction is initiated
by fast activation by Ca2+ of MLCK; 2), that airway SMC, but not
arteriole SMC, is inhibited by a slower activation by Ca2+ of MLCP;
and 3), that the presence of a contractile agonist inhibits MLCP
to enhance the Ca2+ sensitivity of airway and arteriole SMCs. The
implication of these findings is that murine airway SMCs exploit
a Ca2+-dependent mechanism to favor a default state of relaxation.
The rate of SMC relaxation is determined principally by the rate
of release of the latch-bridge state, which is predicted to be faster
in airway than in arteriole. In addition, the model also predicts
that oscillations in calcium concentration, commonly observed during
agonist-induced smooth muscle contraction, cause a significantly
greater contraction than an elevated steady calcium concentration.},

abstract = {Development and optimization of methods for adequately accounting
for respiratory motion in radiation therapy of thoracic tumors require
detailed knowledge of respiratory dynamics and its impact on corresponding
dose distributions. Thus, computer aided modeling and simulation
of respiratory motion have become increasingly important. In this
article a biophysical approach for modeling respiratory lung motion
is described: Major aspects of the process of lung ventilation are
formulated as a contact problem of elasticity theory which is solved
by finite element methods; lung tissue is assumed to be isotropic,
homogeneous, and linearly elastic. A main focus of the article is
to assess the impact of biomechanical parameters (values of elastic
constants) on the modeling process and to evaluate modeling accuracy.
Patient-specific models are generated based on 4D CT data of 12 lung
tumor patients. Simulated motion patterns of inner lung landmarks
are compared with corresponding motion patterns observed in the 4D
CT data. Mean absolute differences between model-based predicted
landmark motion and corresponding breathing-induced landmark displacements
as observed in the CT data sets are in the order of 3 mm (end expiration
to end inspiration) and 2 mm (end expiration to midrespiration).
Modeling accuracy decreases with increasing tumor size both locally
(landmarks close to tumor) and globally (landmarks in other parts
of the lung). The impact of the values of the elastic constants appears
to be small. Outcomes show that the modeling approach is an adequate
strategy in predicting lung dynamics due to lung ventilation. Nevertheless,
the decreased prediction quality in cases of large tumors demands
further study of the influence of lung tumors on global and local
lung elasticity properties.},

modelling techniques were used to describe the mechanical ventilator
and the flexible hoses that connect it to the patient. 3D CFD techniques
were used to model flow in the major airways and a Windkessel style
balloon model was used to model the mechanical properties of the
lungs. A multi-compartment model of the lung based on bifurcating
tree structures representing the conducting airways and pulmonary
circulation allowed lung disease to be modelled in terms of altered
V ? / Q ? ratios within a lognormal distribution of values and it
is from these that gas exchange was determined. A compartmental modelling
tool, Bathfp, was used to integrate the different modelling techniques
into a single model. The values of key parameters in the model could
be obtained from measurements on patients in an ICU whilst a sensitivity
analysis showed that the model was insensitive to the value of other
parameters within it. Measured and modelled values for arterial blood
gases and airflow parameters are compared for 46 ventilator settings
obtained from 6 ventilator dependent patients. The results show correlation
coefficients of 0.88 and 0.85 for the arterial partial pressures

abstract = { A representative human tracheobronchial tree has been geometrically
represented with adjustable triple-bifurcation units (TBUs) in order
to effectively simulate local and global micron particle depositions.
It is the first comprehensive attempt to compute micron-particle
transport in a (Weibel Type A) 16-generation model with realistic
inlet conditions. The CFD modeling predictions are compared to experimental
observations as well as analytical modeling results. Based on the
findings with the validated computer simulation model, the following
conclusions can be drawn: (i) Surprisingly, simulated inspiratory
deposition fractions for the entire tracheobronchial region (say,
G0-G15) with repeated TBUs in parallel and in series agree rather
well with those calculated using analytical/semi-empirical expressions.
However, the predicted particle-deposition fractions based on such
analytical formulas differ greatly from the present simulation results
for most local bifurcations, due to the effects of local geometry
and resulting local flow features and particle distributions. Clearly,
the effects of realistic geometries, flow structures and particle
distributions in different individual bifurcations accidentally cancel
each other so that the simulated deposition efficiencies during inspiration
in a relatively large airway region may agree quite well with those
obtained from analytical expressions. Furthermore, with the lack
of local resolution, analytical models do not provide any physical
insight to the air-particle dynamics in the tracheobronchial region.
(ii) The maximum deposition enhancement factors (DEF) may be in the
order of 102 to 103 for micron particles in the tracheobronchial
airways, implying potential health effects when the inhaled particles
are toxic. (iii) The presence of sedimentation for micron particles
in lower bronchial airways may change the local impaction-based deposition
patterns seen for larger airways and hence reduces the maximum DEF
values. (iv) Rotation of an airway bifurcation cause a significant
impact on distal bifurcations rather than on the proximal ones. Such
geometric effects are minor when compared to the effects of airflow
and particle transport/deposition history, i.e., upstream effects.},

abstract = {The authors are developing a computerized pulmonary vessel segmentation method for a computer-aided pulmonary embolism (PE) detection system on computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) images. Because PE only occurs inside pulmonary arteries, an automatic and accurate segmentation of the pulmonary vessels in 3D CTPA images is an essential step for the PE CAD system. To segment the pulmonary vessels within the lung, the lung regions are first extracted using expectation-maximization (EM) analysis and morphological operations. The authors developed a 3D multiscale filtering technique to enhance the pulmonary vascular structures based on the analysis of eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at multiple scales. A new response function of the filter was designed to enhance all vascular structures including the vessel bifurcations and suppress nonvessel structures such as the lymphoid tissues surrounding the vessels. An EM estimation is then used to segment the vascular structures by extracting the high response voxels at each scale. The vessel tree is finally reconstructed by integrating the segmented vessels at all scales based on a "connected component" analysis. Two CTPA cases containing PEs were used to evaluate the performance of the system. One of these two cases also contained pleural effusion disease. Two experienced thoracic radiologists provided the gold standard of pulmonary vessels including both arteries and veins by manually tracking the arterial tree and marking the center of the vessels using a computer graphical user interface. The accuracy of vessel tree segmentation was evaluated by the percentage of the "gold standard" vessel center points overlapping with the segmented vessels. The results show that 96.2\% (2398/2494) and 96.3\% (1910/1984) of the manually marked center points in the arteries overlapped with segmented vessels for the case without and with other lung diseases. For the manually marked center points in all vessels including arteries and veins, the segmentation accuracy are 97.0\% (4546/4689) and 93.8\% (4439/4732) for the cases without and with other lung diseases, respectively. Because of the lack of ground truth for the vessels, in addition to quantitative evaluation of the vessel segmentation performance, visual inspection was conducted to evaluate the segmentation. The results demonstrate that vessel segmentation using our method can extract the pulmonary vessels accurately and is not degraded by PE occlusion to the vessels in these test cases.},

abstract = {Detailed description of the flow field in human airways is highly important to better understand human breathing and provide a patient's customized diagnosis. An integrated numerical simulation platform is presently proposed in order to incorporate medical images into a numerical software to calculate flow field and to analyze it in terms of fluid dynamics. The platform was set up to compute steady inspiratory airflow in realistic human airways reconstructed from tomodensitometric medical images at resting breathing conditions. This morpho-functional simulation platform has been tested retrospectively with two CT-scanned patient airway morphological models: (i) a normal airway model (subject A) with no evidence of morphological alteration and (ii) a highly altered airway model (subject B) exhibiting a severe stenosis in the right main bronchus. First, various morphological aspects proper to each airway model are provided to show the performance and interest of the reconstruction method. Second, we describe the three-dimensional flow patterns associated to the global morphological features, which are mainly shared by the present realistic models and previous idealistic airway models. Finally, the flow characteristics associated to local morphological features specific to realistic airway models are discussed. The results demonstrate that the morpho-functional simulation platform is able to capture the main features of airway velocity patterns but also more specific airflow patterns which are related to customized patient morphological features such as laminar vortex formation. The present results suggest that the proposed airway functional imaging platform is adequate to provide most of functional information related to airflow and enable a patient to patient diagnosis.},
